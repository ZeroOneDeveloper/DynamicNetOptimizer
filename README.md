# Dynamic Neural Network Optimizer
## Dynamic Neural Network Optimizer is an automated tool designed to identify the most efficient configuration of hidden layers and neurons in neural networks. This project aims to simplify and expedite the optimization process, ensuring that neural networks operate at peak efficiency for various tasks.

## AI Exploration Performance Tasks for the 1st Semester of 2024
## Reason For Selection
The primary reason for conducting this exploration was to streamline and automate the process of configuring neural networks. Determining the optimal number of hidden layers and neurons is crucial for the performance and efficiency of neural networks. Manual tuning can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially for those new to machine learning. By developing the Dynamic Neural Network Optimizer, we aimed to create a tool that simplifies this process, making it more accessible and efficient for researchers and practitioners. This project represents our commitment to improving the usability and performance of neural networks through innovative automation techniques.
